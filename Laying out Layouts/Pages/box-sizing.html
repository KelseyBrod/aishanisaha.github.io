        <h1>How can we safely package waste?</h1>
        <h2>Safe storage of radioactive nuclear waste is a major concern for environmentalists.</h2>
        <img src="../Images/Boxmodeldetail.png" alt="Box model details" class="boxmodel">
        <p>Nuclear waste is very easily packaged to keep everyone safe. The content of the waste gets solidified into glass form, depicted in dark red. 
            Then, the glass is packaged in stainless steel cannisters, depicted in orange. 
            The orange stainless steel acts as a padding for the waste. 
            Then, for further protection, the stainless steel cannister is placed in heavily shielded casks, depicted in white. This is the final border around the waste.
            Finally, the cask is placed under the Yucca Mountain in Nevada. There is space, or margins, between each cask.  
            With the multiple guard-points around the non-reactive glass waste, there is very little to no chance of radiation exposure.</p>
