        <p>I want each character (friend) to be clickable, which can be done with javascript. On click, there will be a pop up asking whether the user wants to 
            chat, phone call, or video call. I would purchase a chat software, a video call software, and an audio call software. Depending on the user's choice of communication
            method, one of the connected softwares will open. <br> <br>
            The "add friend" button will allow users to place their friend's email into the input field. This will connect the friend's email to the current user's email. 
            This connection will be saved on the user's account. So, whenever the user enters Contacto, they are able to see their friends, if their friends are active. <br> <br>
            We would be able to tell the activity status of friends based on whether they are logged onto the website or not.
