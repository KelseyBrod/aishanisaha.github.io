            Nuclear energy is America’s work horse. It’s been rolling up its sleeves for six decades now to provide constant, reliable, carbon-free power to millions of Americans. Just how reliable has nuclear energy been?
            <ul>
                <li>It has roughly supplied a fifth of America’s power each year since 1990. </li>
                <li>Nuclear energy has by far the highest capacity factor of any other non-fossil fuel energy source. This basically means nuclear power plants are producing maximum power more than 92% of the time during the year. That’s nearly 2 times more than natural gas and coal units, and almost 3 times or more reliable than wind and solar plants. </li>
            </ul>

<u>Are Nuclear Power Plants More Reliable?</u> 
Nuclear power plants are typically used more often because they require less maintenance and are designed to operate for longer stretches before refueling. <br>

Renewable plants are considered intermittent or variable sources and are mostly limited by a lack of fuel (i.e. wind, sun, or water). As a result, these plants need a backup power source such as large-scale storage (not currently available at grid-scale)—or they can be paired with a reliable baseload power like nuclear energy.

                                <b>Why Are Nuclear Power Plants More Reliable?</b>
                                Nuclear power plants are typically used more often because they require less maintenance and are designed to operate for longer stretches before refueling (typically every 1.5 or 2 years).

                                Natural gas and coal capacity factors are generally lower due to routine maintenance and/or refueling at these facilities.

                                Renewable plants are considered intermittent or variable sources and are mostly limited by a lack of fuel (i.e. wind, sun, or water). As a result, these plants need a backup power source such as large-scale storage (not currently available at grid-scale)—or they can be paired with a reliable baseload power like nuclear energy.

                                <b>Why Does This Matter?</b>
                                A typical nuclear reactor produces 1 gigawatt (GW) of electricity. That doesn’t mean you can simply replace it with a 1 gigawatt coal or renewable plant.

                                Based on the capacity factors above, you would need almost two coal or three to four renewable plants (each of 1 GW size) to generate the same amount of electricity onto the grid.
